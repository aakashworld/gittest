<h1>  Hippo Poem and Alligator Poem   </h1>

<p> My favorite <a href="http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/ogden_nash/poems/19638">poem</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus">Hippos</a>.
    Here is how it goes</p>

<pre>Behold the hippopotamus!
We laugh at how he looks to us,
And yet in moments dank and grim,
    I wonder how we look to him. </pre>

<pre>Peace, peace, thou hippopotamus!
We really look all right to us,
As you no doubt delight the eye,
    Of other hippopotami. </pre>

<pre>
    at the edge of the water
and if the white birds standing
in the tops of the trees whistled any warning
I didn't understand,
I drank up to the very moment it came
crashing toward me,
its tail flailing
like a bundle of swords,
slashing the grass,
and the inside of its cradle-shaped mouth
gaping,
and rimmed with teeth--
and that's how I almost died
of foolishness
in beautiful Florida.
But I didn't.
I leaped aside, and fell,
and it streamed past me, crushing everything in its path
as it swept down to the water
and threw itself in,
and, in the end,
this isn't a poem about foolishness
but about how I rose from the ground and saw the world as if for the second time,
the way it really is.
The water, that circle of shattered glass,
healed itself with a slow whisper
and lay back
with the back-lit light of polished steel,
and the birds, in the endless waterfalls of the trees,
shook open the snowy pleats of their wings, and drifted away,
while, for a keepsake, and to steady myself,
I reached out,
I picked the wild flowers from the grass around me--
blue stars
and blood-red trumpets
on long green stems--
for hours in my trembling hands they glittered
like fire.</pre>
